# AlphaUMI
433 light-years away, the motionless star of Alpha Ursae Minoris has shined upon lost adventurers showing them the way to their destination. Today and in the future, as the stars continue their motion, Alpha Ursae Minoris (which we will dearly call Alpha Umi) will remain relevant and everchanging. With this reasoning in mind, we chose to name our team after the Polar Star, and we designed the logo of our project accordingly.
Alpha project aims to connect the past with the present. There is no better time than the present; it is the time for action and for all endeavors. That said, the present stands on the shoulders of the past and draws from its learnings. Concretely, Alpha is an interactive game that enables the users to relive past NASA missions, at the top of which is Apollo 11. Through dialogues and tasks, the user converses with the key figures that contributed to the mission, assists them in NASA offices, and learns along the way what it takes to send humanity on the moon. At the forefront of the objectives of the game is to demystify NASA operations and processes, as well as to foster a deep interest in space.
Our motto is simple: Learn from the past. Contribute to the present.
